    "# 本題要對字串內的字元重新進行排序，需要改成遞增後遞減的順序\n",

    "Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.  \n",
    "Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.  \n",
    "Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.  \n",
    "Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.  \n",
    "Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.  \n",
    "Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.  \n",
    "Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.  \n",
