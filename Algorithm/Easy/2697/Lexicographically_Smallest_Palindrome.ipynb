    "You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase English letter.  \n",
    "Your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.  \n",
    "A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.  \n",
    "Return the resulting palindrome string.  \n",

    "Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make \"egcfe\" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is \"efcfe\", by changing 'g'.  \n",
