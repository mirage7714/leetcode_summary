    "# 本題要找出移動到每個位置的最小成本是多少 (\\#Array )\n",

    "You are given an integer array cost of size n. You are currently at position n (at the end of the line) in a line of n + 1 people (numbered from 0 to n).  \n",
    "You wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of you charges a specific amount to swap places. The cost to swap with person i is given by cost[i].  \n",
    "You are allowed to swap places with people as follows:  \n",
    "If they are in front of you, you must pay them cost[i] to swap with them.  \n",
    "If they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.  \n",
    "Return an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum total cost to reach each position i in the line.  \n",

    "首先定義一個list用來放結果，接著用一個變數來存放目前的最小成本，然後用迴圈開始計算目前的成本，如果成本小於目前的最小成本則更新成本，最後將每個成本都放入list中就是最後的答案"
