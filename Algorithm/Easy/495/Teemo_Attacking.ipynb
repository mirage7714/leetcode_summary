    "Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.  \n",
