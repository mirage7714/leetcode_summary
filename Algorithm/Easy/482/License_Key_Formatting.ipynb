    "# 本題要將題目要求的字串重新進行排序並插入'-'符號\n",

    "\n",
    "You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.  \n",

    "範例:  \n",

    "Input: S = \"5F3Z-2e-9-w\", K = 4  \n",
    "Output: \"5F3Z-2E9W\"  \n",
    "Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.  \n",
    "Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: S = \"2-5g-3-J\", K = 2  \n",
    "Output: \"2-5G-3J\"  \n",
    "Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above."

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "題目要求將字串中的'-'位置重新進行排序，要以要求的字數來插入'-'，另外英文的部分也要將小寫改成大寫  \n",
    "第一節的字數可以少於要求的數字，但不可為0  \n",
    "因此改成從後面開始往前算，可以確保後面的數字都可以符合題目的要求"
