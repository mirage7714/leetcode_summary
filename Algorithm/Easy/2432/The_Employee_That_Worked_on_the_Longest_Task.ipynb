    "# 本題要找出哪個員工的工作時間最長 (\\#Array)\n",

    "There are n employees, each with a unique id from 0 to n - 1.  \n",

    "You are given a 2D integer array logs where logs[i] = [idi, leaveTimei] where:  \n",

    "idi is the id of the employee that worked on the ith task, and  \n",
    "leaveTimei is the time at which the employee finished the ith task. All the values leaveTimei are unique.  \n",
    "Note that the ith task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)th task ends, and the 0th task starts at time 0.  \n",
