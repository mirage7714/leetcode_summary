    "There are two logs of lengths n and m units, which need to be transported in three trucks where each truck can carry one log with length at most k units.  \n",

    "Cut the log with length 6 into logs with length 1 and 5, at a cost equal to 1 * 5 == 5. Now the three logs of length 1, 5, and 5 can fit in one truck each.  \n",
