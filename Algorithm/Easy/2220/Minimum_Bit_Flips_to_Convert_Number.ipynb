    "A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.  \n",

    "For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.  \n",

    "計算翻轉次數，其實就是找出兩個值轉成bit之後的差異，因此先將兩數都轉換成bit字串之後，接著檢查兩個字串的長度是否相同，如果相同的情況則直接開始比較每個位置的差異並統計，否則需要先在較短的字串前補上0之後再開始進行比較"
