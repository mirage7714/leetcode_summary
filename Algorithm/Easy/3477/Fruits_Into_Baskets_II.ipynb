    "# 本題要找出共有多少水果沒辦法放入籃子內 (\\#Array )\n",

    "You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.  \n",
    "From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:  \n",
    "Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.  \n",
    "Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.  \n",
    "If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.  \n",

    "fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.  \n",
    "fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.  \n",
    "fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.  \n",

    "首先將籃子用index與數值組成新的list後放入heap中，接著從fruit中開始進行檢查，如果籃子符合條件則中斷迴圈，如果不符合條件則繼續迴圈，直到沒有數值或是中斷迴圈為止，最後回傳剩下的籃子數就是答案"
