    "# 本題要找出在小於指定數值的情況下，最大長度的二進位字串為何\n",

    "You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.  \n",
    "Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.  \n",

    "Note:  \n",
    "The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.  \n",
    "The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.  \n",

    "Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is \"00010\", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.  \n",
    "Note that \"00100\" and \"00101\" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.  \n",
    "The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.  \n",

    "The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned."
