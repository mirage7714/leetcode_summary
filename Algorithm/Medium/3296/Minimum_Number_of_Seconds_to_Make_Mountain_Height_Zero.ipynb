    "# 本題要找出到達指定的數值需要的最小秒數是多少 (\\#Array, \\#Heap )\n",

    "\n",
    "You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.  \n",
    "You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.  \n",
    "The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:  \n",
    "To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds.   \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.  \n",
    "To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.  \n",
    "Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.  \n",

    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]  \n",
    "Output: 3  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:  \n",
    "Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.  \n",
    "Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.  \n",
    "Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.  \n",
    "Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]  \n",
    "Output: 12  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.  \n",
    "Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.  \n",
    "Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.  \n",
    "Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.  \n",
    "The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex3:  \n",
    "Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]  \n",
    "Output: 15  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15."
