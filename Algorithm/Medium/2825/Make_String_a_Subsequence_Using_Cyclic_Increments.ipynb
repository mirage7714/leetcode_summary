    "# 本題要找出是否可以藉由移動產生另一個字串 (\\#String, \\#TwoPointers)\n",

    "You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.  \n",
    "In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.  \n",
    "Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.  \n",
    "Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.  \n",

    "Explanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 using the operation at most once.   \n",
    "Therefore, false is returned."
