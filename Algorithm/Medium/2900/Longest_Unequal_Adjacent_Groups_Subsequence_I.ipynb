    "You are given an integer n, a 0-indexed string array words, and a 0-indexed binary array groups, both arrays having length n.  \n",
    "You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1], such that for the subsequence denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik - 1] having length k, groups[ij] != groups[ij + 1], for each j where 0 < j + 1 < k.  \n",
