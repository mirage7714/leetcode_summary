    "You are given an integer total indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers cost1 and cost2 indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend part or all of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.  \n",

    "Explanation: The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils."
