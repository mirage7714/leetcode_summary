    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and an integer k.  \n",
    "In one operation, you will:  \n",
    "Take the two smallest integers x and y in nums.  \n",
    "Remove x and y from nums.  \n",

    "Explanation: In the first operation, we remove elements 1 and 2, then add 1 * 2 + 2 to nums. nums becomes equal to [4, 11, 10, 3].  \n",

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "與3065相似，一樣是先將nums轉換成heap，接著用迴圈開始取值，先檢查第一個值是否大於或等於k，如果大於k則中斷迴圈，否則取出第二個值並依題目的算法將該數值加入heap中，最後回傳回傳迴圈執行的次數就是答案"
