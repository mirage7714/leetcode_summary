    "# 本題要找出只有出現一次，且也沒有相鄰數字出現的值共有多少\n",

    "You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]   \n",
    "Output: [10,8]  \n",
    "Explanation:   \n",
    "- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.  \n",
    "- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.  \n",
    "- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.  \n",
    "Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].  \n",
    "Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]  \n",
    "Output: [1,5]  \n",
    "Explanation:   \n",
    "- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.  \n",
    "- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.  \n",
    "- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.  \n",
    "Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].  \n",
    "Note that [5, 1] may also be returned."

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "首先將原本的list轉換為出現次數的dict，接著開始檢查key與value，當value是1的時候則檢查key值相鄰的數值是否存在，如果都不存在則放入另一個list中，最後回傳list就是題目要找的答案"
