    "# 本題要找出計算最大的利潤為和\n",
    "原題目連結: https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i].   \n",
    "\n",
    "Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most profit we can make?  \n",
    "\n",
    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]  \n",
    "Output: 100   \n",
    "Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.  "

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "嘗試了幾種方法，以下是各種方法的心得:  \n",
    "- 將difficulty與profit使用一個dict來建立mapping，並將每個difficulty能產生的最大profit補上 -- 結果Time Limit Exceeded   \n",
    "- 將difficulty與profit用zip方式組成list，並使用for迴圈來檢查每個worker可以拿到的最高profit -- 結果Time Limit Exceeded  \n",
    "- 將diffuculty與profit用zip方式組成list，並改成用while迴圈來檢查每個worker可以拿到的最高profit -- 結果Pass  \n",
    "從測試的結果看起來while迴圈的效能好像略好過for迴圈，之後可能要改多嘗試用while迴圈解題了"
