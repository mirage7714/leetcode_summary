    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array buses of length n, where buses[i] represents the departure time of the ith bus. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array passengers of length m, where passengers[j] represents the arrival time of the jth passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.  \n",

    "You are given an integer capacity, which represents the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.  \n",
    "The passengers will get on the next available bus. You can get on a bus that will depart at x minutes if you arrive at y minutes where y <= x, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus first.  \n",
    "Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.  \n",

    "首先將公車時刻表與乘客到站時間排序後，接著找出每班公車搭載的乘客到站時間為何，接著開始從最後一班公車的乘客時間開始檢查，如果最後一班公車沒搭滿且公車到站時間沒人等車的話，則最晚到達時間就是公車到站時間，否則就是從後面開始檢查乘客到站的時間，如果中間有時間是沒有乘客等待的，就是最晚要到站的時間"
