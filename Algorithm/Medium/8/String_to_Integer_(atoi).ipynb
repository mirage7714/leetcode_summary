    "# 本題要實作一個可以將字串轉換為數字的函數\n",
    "原題目連結: https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/  \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.  \n",
    "Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.  \n",
    "Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.  \n",
    "Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).  \n",
    "If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.  \n",
    "Return the integer as the final result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.  \n",
    "Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: s = \"42\"  \n",
    "Output: 42  \n",
    "Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.  \n",
    "Step 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)    \n",
    "Step 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')  \n",
    "Step 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)  \n",
    "The parsed integer is 42.  \n",
    "Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: s = \"   -42\"  \n",
    "Output: -42  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Step 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)  \n",
    "Step 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)  \n",
    "Step 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)  \n",
    "The parsed integer is -42.  \n",
    "Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex3:  \n",
    "Input: s = \"4193 with words\"  \n",
    "Output: 4193  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Step 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)  \n",
    "Step 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')  \n",
    "Step 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)  \n",
    "The parsed integer is 4193.  \n",
    "Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193."

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "首先將字串用空白進行分割，接著找出第一個不為空白的字串來進行檢查，如果開頭是+或是-則另外存成變數，如果是數字則放入另一個變數中，接著繼續檢查，第二個字如果是數字則繼續放入變數中，直到出現的不是數字為止，接著檢查數字的長度，如果等於0則直接回傳0，否則轉成整數後檢查大小與是否有超過整數的最大上限"
