    "# 本題要找出需要滿足需求的最小成本是多少 (\\#Math )\n",
    "原題目連結: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-acquire-required-items/description/  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given five integers `cost1`, `cost2`, `costBoth`, `need1`, and `need2`.    \n",
    "There are three types of items available:  \n",
    "- An item of type 1 costs cost1 and contributes 1 unit to the type 1 requirement only.  \n",
    "- An item of type 2 costs cost2 and contributes 1 unit to the type 2 requirement only.  \n",
    "- An item of type 3 costs costBoth and contributes 1 unit to both type 1 and type 2 requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You must collect enough items so that the total contribution toward type 1 is at least need1 and the total contribution toward type 2 is at least need2.  \n",
    "Return an integer representing the minimum possible total cost to achieve these requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: cost1 = 3, cost2 = 2, costBoth = 1, need1 = 3, need2 = 2  \n",
    "Output: 3  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "After buying three type 3 items, which cost 3 * 1 = 3, the total contribution to type 1 is 3 (>= need1 = 3) and to type 2 is 3 (>= need2 = 2).  \n",
    "Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 2, need2 = 3  \n",
    "Output: 22  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "We buy need1 = 2 items of type 1 and need2 = 3 items of type 2: 2 * 5 + 3 * 4 = 10 + 12 = 22.  \n",
    "Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 22.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex3:  \n",
    "Input: cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 0, need2 = 0  \n",
    "Output: 0  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Since no items are required (need1 = need2 = 0), we buy nothing and pay 0."

    "* 解題想法:\n",
    "這個題目可以用列舉的方式，將所有可能的組合列出:\n",
    "- costBoth小於cost1與cost2的情況: 全部都用costBoth的方案，總成本為`max(need1, need2) x costBoth`  \n",
    "- costBoth小於cost1: 如果need1大於need2，則總成本為`costBoth x need1`，否則成本為`costBoth x need1 + cost2 x (need2 - need1)`\n",
    "- costBoth小於cost2: 如果need2大於need1，則總成本為`costBith x need2`，否則成本為`costBoth x need2 + cost1 x (need1 - need2)`\n",
    "- costBoth小於cost1 + cost2: 這邊需要考量兩個情境: need1 > need2 或是need2 > need1  \n",
    "  - 如果need1大於need2，則考量`costBoth x need1`與`costBoth x need2 + cost1 x (need1 - need2)`的最小值  \n",
    "  - 如果need2大於need1，則考量`costBith x need2`與`costBith x need1 + cost2 x (need2 - need1)`的最小值\n",
    "- 最後的情況就是單獨購買是最低成本，所以總成本就是`cost1 x need1 + cost2 x need2`  "
