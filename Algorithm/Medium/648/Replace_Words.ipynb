    "In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root \"an\" is followed by the successor word \"other\", we can form a new word \"another\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sentence after the replacement.  \n",

    "* 解題想法：  \n",
    "依題目的說明，要找出句子中的字是否含有dictionary中的字首，如果有的話要將字替換為字首  \n",
    "因此先將原本的list轉換成dict並用第一個字母當成key值，在比對的時候用第一個字母當成比較的目標，如果有出現則將結果的list取出並進行排序  \n",
    "接著檢查文字的開頭是否有出現在list中，如果有則將文字取代並中斷迴圈，最後將新的字串進行回傳"
