    "You are given two integers w and m, and an integer array arrivals, where arrivals[i] is the type of item arriving on day i (days are 1-indexed).  \n",
    "Items are managed according to the following rules:  \n",
    "Each arrival may be kept or discarded; an item may only be discarded on its arrival day.  \n",
    "For each day i, consider the window of days [max(1, i - w + 1), i] (the w most recent days up to day i):  \n",
    "For any such window, each item type may appear at most m times among kept arrivals whose arrival day lies in that window.  \n",
    "If keeping the arrival on day i would cause its type to appear more than m times in the window, that arrival must be discarded.  \n",
    "Return the minimum number of arrivals to be discarded so that every w-day window contains at most m occurrences of each type.  \n",

    "Input: arrivals = [1,2,1,3,1], w = 4, m = 2  \n",
    "Output: 0  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "On day 1, Item 1 arrives; the window contains no more than m occurrences of this type, so we keep it.  \n",
    "On day 2, Item 2 arrives; the window of days 1 - 2 is fine.  \n",
    "On day 3, Item 1 arrives, window [1, 2, 1] has item 1 twice, within limit.  \n",
    "On day 4, Item 3 arrives, window [1, 2, 1, 3] has item 1 twice, allowed.  \n",
    "On day 5, Item 1 arrives, window [2, 1, 3, 1] has item 1 twice, still valid.  \n",
    "There are no discarded items, so return 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: arrivals = [1,2,3,3,3,4], w = 3, m = 2  \n",
    "Output: 1  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "On day 1, Item 1 arrives. We keep it.  \n",
    "On day 2, Item 2 arrives, window [1, 2] is fine.  \n",
    "On day 3, Item 3 arrives, window [1, 2, 3] has item 3 once.  \n",
    "On day 4, Item 3 arrives, window [2, 3, 3] has item 3 twice, allowed.  \n",
    "On day 5, Item 3 arrives, window [3, 3, 3] has item 3 three times, exceeds limit, so the arrival must be discarded.  \n",
    "On day 6, Item 4 arrives, window [3, 4] is fine.  \n",
    "Item 3 on day 5 is discarded, and this is the minimum number of arrivals to discard, so return 1."

    "建立一個dict來存放目前每個數字出現的次數，然後再用一個set來存放被丟棄的index，最後用一個變數來記錄丟棄的個數，接著用迴圈開始進行檢查，如果該數出現次數小於極限則更新目前出現的次數，如果超過極限則除了記錄丟棄的數值之外也需要紀錄被丟棄的index，最後回傳被丟棄的個數就是答案"
