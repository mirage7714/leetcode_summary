    "# 本題要找出有多少不重複的顏色數量 (\\#HashMap, \\#Array )\n",

    "\n",
    "You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.  \n",
    "There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit]. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.  \n",
    "Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after ith query.  \n",
    "Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.  \n",

    "* 解題想法:   \n",
    "首先用一個dict，用顏色當作key值，並把出現的index作為子dict的key值，另外用一個dict，用index作為key值，來存放該index上一次出現的顏色，接著用迴圈放入顏色: 如果該顏色沒出現過則新增該顏色的key值，並把對應的值分別放入兩個dict中，如果該index有出現過，則取出該index上一次出現的顏色，並從該顏色終將index移除，最後將目前有出現過的顏色數量放入list中，最後回傳list就是答案"
