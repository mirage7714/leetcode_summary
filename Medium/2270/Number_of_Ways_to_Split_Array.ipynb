    "# 本題要找出共有幾種分割list並符合條件的方式\n",

    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.  \n",
    "\n",
    "nums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the first i + 1 elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last n - i - 1 elements.  \n",

    "- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.  \n",
