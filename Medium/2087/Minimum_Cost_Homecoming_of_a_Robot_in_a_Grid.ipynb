    "There is an m x n grid, where (0, 0) is the top-left cell and (m - 1, n - 1) is the bottom-right cell. You are given an integer array startPos where startPos = [startrow, startcol] indicates that initially, a robot is at the cell (startrow, startcol). You are also given an integer array homePos where homePos = [homerow, homecol] indicates that its home is at the cell (homerow, homecol).  \n",

    "The robot needs to go to its home. It can move one cell in four directions: left, right, up, or down, and it can not move outside the boundary. Every move incurs some cost. You are further given two 0-indexed integer arrays: rowCosts of length m and colCosts of length n.  \n",
