    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.  \n",

    "In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.  \n",
    "For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].  \n",
    "In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.  \n",
    "If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.  \n",

    "- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.  \n",

    "* 解題想法:  \n",
    "首先檢查costs的長度是否等於要雇用的人數，如果是的話則成本就是全部的cost總和，另外如果costs的長度小於2倍的候選人時，則總成本就是從costs中取出最小的k個值，如果都不符合，則將前面幾個候選人與後面幾個候選人轉換成heap，接著開始從這兩個取值比較，如果前面的值比較小則前面需再放入新的數值，如果是後面叫小則放入新的值到後面。最後回傳總成本就是答案"
