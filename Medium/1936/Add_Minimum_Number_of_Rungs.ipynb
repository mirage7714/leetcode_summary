    "You are also given an integer dist. You can only climb to the next highest rung if the distance between where you are currently at (the floor or on a rung) and the next rung is at most dist. You are able to insert rungs at any positive integer height if a rung is not already there.  \n",

    "首先建立一個初始值為0，接著開始從頭檢查list中的數值，如果當數值與初始值的差距大於dist時，則檢查這個差距是否有大於2 x dist，如果在這個範圍內，則將count+1，如果超過這範圍的話，則將count+1+(差距-2 x dist)/dist無條件進位，最後回傳count值"
