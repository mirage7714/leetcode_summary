    "# 本題要找出經過power之後的排序並取出第K個數值 (\\#Array, \\#Heap)\n",

    "The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to transform x into 1 using the following steps:  \n",
    "if x is even then x = x / 2  \n",
    "if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1  \n",
    "For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).  \n",

    "Return the kth integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value.  \n",

    "Notice that for any integer x (lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will transform into 1 using these steps and that the power of x is will fit in a 32-bit signed integer.  \n",
