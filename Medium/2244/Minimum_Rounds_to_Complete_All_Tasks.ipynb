    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.  \n",
    "Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.  \n",

    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]  \n",
    "Output: 4  \n",
    "Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:  \n",
    "- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2.   \n",
    "- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3.   \n",
    "- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4.   \n",
    "- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.    \n",
    "It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: tasks = [2,3,3]  \n",
    "Output: -1  \n",
    "Explanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.  "

    "首先找出每個任務的統計結果，接著判斷每個task統計值為多少，如果為1的話則不符合要求，直接回傳-1，如果大於1的話則將值除三後檢查餘數，如果餘數為0則將結果加上除三之後的商，其餘兩種情況(餘1或2)則將結果加上傷再加1，最後回傳結果"
