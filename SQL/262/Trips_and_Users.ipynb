    "  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.  \n",

    "  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.  \n",
    "  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00  \n",
    "On 2013-10-03:  \n",
    "  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.  \n",
    "  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.  \n",
    "  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.  \n",
