    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.  \n",
    "Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:  \n",

    "If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:  \n",
    "Increment the count of tested devices.  \n",
    "Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).  \n",
    "Move to the next device.  \n",

    "Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:  \n",
    "At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].  \n",
    "At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.  \n",
    "At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].  \n",
    "At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.  \n",
    "At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.  \n",
