    "Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.  \n",

    "For example, if word = \"abcdefd\" and ch = \"d\", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be \"dcbaefd\".  \n",
