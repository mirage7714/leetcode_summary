    "There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.  \n",

    "Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.  \n",

    "由於要找出兩個顏色間的最大距離為多少，因此首先要找出每個顏色分布的情況，接著找出每個顏色的分布最大值與最小值分別為多少，並用兩個顏色的直來進行比較，最後找出兩個顏色間的距離最大值為多少"
