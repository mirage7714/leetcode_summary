    "You are given an integer array nums. We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].  \n",
    "\n",
    "base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].  \n",

    "Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.  \n",

    "Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.  \n",

    "Ex4:  \n",
    "Input: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]  \n",
    "Output: false  \n",
    "Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false."

    "首先將nums轉為heap，並先取出第一個數值，如果nums為空則回傳False，另外如果第一個數值不為1也回傳False，接著用迴圈開始取值，如果當nums為空，且取出的數值不等於暫存則回傳False，否則回傳True，如果當nums部為空，而暫存不等於數值-1時也回傳False，最後當nums為空時則回傳True"
