    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array ranks and a character array suits. You have 5 cards where the ith card has a rank of ranks[i] and a suit of suits[i].  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Flush\": Five cards of the same suit.  \n",
    "\"Three of a Kind\": Three cards of the same rank.  \n",
    "\"Pair\": Two cards of the same rank.  \n",
    "\"High Card\": Any single card.  \n",
    "Return a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards.  \n",

    "Input: ranks = [13,2,3,1,9], suits = [\"a\",\"a\",\"a\",\"a\",\"a\"]  \n",
    "Output: \"Flush\"  \n",
    "Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a \"Flush\".  \n",

    "Input: ranks = [4,4,2,4,4], suits = [\"d\",\"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]  \n",
    "Output: \"Three of a Kind\"  \n",
    "Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a \"Three of a Kind\".  \n",
    "Note that we could also make a \"Pair\" hand but \"Three of a Kind\" is a better hand.  \n",
    "Also note that other cards could be used to make the \"Three of a Kind\" hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex3:  \n",
    "Input: ranks = [10,10,2,12,9], suits = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"a\",\"d\"]  \n",
    "Output: \"Pair\"  \n",
    "Explanation: The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards with the same rank, so we have a \"Pair\".  \n",
    "Note that we cannot make a \"Flush\" or a \"Three of a Kind\"."
