    "You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2, that represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.  \n",
    "The bowling game consists of n turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.  \n",
    "Assume a player hit xi pins in the ith turn. The value of the ith turn for the player is:  \n",

    "2xi if the player hit 10 pins in any of the previous two turns.  \n",
