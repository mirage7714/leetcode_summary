    "You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.  \n",
    "Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.  \n",
    "Return the capitalized title.  \n",

    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: title = \"capiTalIze tHe titLe\"  \n",
    "Output: \"Capitalize The Title\"  \n",
    "Explanation:    \n",
    "Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex2:  \n",
    "Input: title = \"First leTTeR of EACH Word\"  \n",
    "Output: \"First Letter of Each Word\"  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "The word \"of\" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.  \n",
    "The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex3:  \n",
    "Input: title = \"i lOve leetcode\"  \n",
    "Output: \"i Love Leetcode\"  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "The word \"i\" has length 1, so it is lowercase.  \n",
    "The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase."

    "首先統一將字串全部轉換為小寫，接著開始逐字判斷條件，如果長度大於2個字的，則將首自改為大寫並重新組合，最後回傳組合好的字串就是題目要找的答案"
