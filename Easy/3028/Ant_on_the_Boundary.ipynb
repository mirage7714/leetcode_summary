    "An ant is on a boundary. It sometimes goes left and sometimes right.  \n",

    "If nums[i] < 0, it moves left by -nums[i] units.  \n",

    "After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.  \n",
    "After the third step, the ant is on the boundary.  \n",

    "After the fourth step, the ant is 2 steps to the left of the boundary.  \n",
    "The ant never returned to the boundary, so the answer is 0."
