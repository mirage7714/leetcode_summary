    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.  \n",

    "Explanation:  \n",
    "At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.  \n",
    "At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill.   \n",
    "At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.  \n",
    "At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.  \n",
    "At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.  \n",
    "At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.   \n",

    "由於兩邊的邊界都不在計算範圍內，因此迴圈的範圍從1~n-1開始，接著檢查左右兩邊的值，如果可判斷為高點/低點，則將計算值+1，如果右邊的值為相等，則用一個字串來判斷現在是屬於可能的高點/低點，並到下一個數值時檢查是否符合目前的情境，如果不符合則繼續往下，最後回傳統計值"
