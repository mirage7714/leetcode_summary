    "# 本題目要找出指定員工id的重要性\n",
    "原題目連結: https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, their importance value and their direct subordinates' id.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "範例:  \n",
    "Ex1:  \n",
    "Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1  \n",
    "Output: 11  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.  "

    "另外要特別注意的是所屬的員工也可能會有所屬的員工，因此使用了一個list來儲存所屬的員工ID，直到list都清空了才結束"
